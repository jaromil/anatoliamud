-1 ANATOLIA~
. 
      ANATOLIA started in early September 1996, using Rom2.4 code. In
June of 1997, ANATOLIA II was started, eventually replacing the original
ANATOLIA.

The following people contributed to the ANATOLIA flavor of the ROM base
code:

Addition of New Areas --
	Ibrahim Canpunar, Serdar Bulut and Murat Bicer

Revision of New Areas --
	Ibrahim Canpunar

Revision and Addition of New Helps --
	Ibrahim Canpunar and Serdar Bulut

Additional Maps --
	Ibrahim Canpunar

Ideas and playtesting --
    So many dedicated mudders around the world. Especially Amac Ural,
Mustafa Ongel, Ibrahim Uzel, Rasit Gumus, David Heide.

Complete C Code --
	chiefly by Serdar Bulut,
        with major contributions by Murat Bicer,
        and also Ibrahim Canpunar and Devrim Baris Acar. 

Used snippets (Available on internet) --
	Quest Code (c) 1996 Ryan Addams (moongate@moongate.ams.com)
	Some snippets by Erwin S. Andreasen.

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Tesseract, the latest version of the ROM code.
It can be found at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used. 

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle (my wife) and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
.
	'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game. Here, anyone of level 92 or higher
is an 'immortal.' Immortals are capable of exceeding the usual game rules, in 
more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase; examples range from 
teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to creation of objects, removal
of a player's privileges (channels, ability to move, or even ability to log 
in), and ability to promote players to immortality.

	Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal behavior is
that no immortal can aid or assist any player without explicit permission from 
the higher ranks; in other words, please don't ask an immortal to help you kill
a mob, gather EQ, etc, or you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, 
or referred to this file.

	The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

92 JOBS~
.
	This is a partial list of what a god of any given level should be 
doing. It is not complete yet.

ANGELS (92-94):

	Angels and higher level gods may not assist mortals directly in any way.
An angels' main job is controling the roleplaying of the game. Mostly each angle
is responsible for one cabal. Responsibility means here that making sure that
the cabal members are acting according to the roleplaying theme. But an angel
cannot induct a player to his/her cabal, unless there is no mortal cabal leader
of that cabal. An angel may have a mortal char as well. But he/she cannot help
his/her mortal char in any sense. Violation of this rule is instant deletion!

DEITIES (95-96):

	Deities have two main roles: reimbursement and quest running. Be 
skeptical on reimburses, don't just hand out every piece of gear. I suggest 
limiting reimbursements to 10 items at a time, and make sure that you do not 
load things at too high a level (new format items have hard-coded levels, so 
are not a problem).  Vnum and stat are useful for this.  DON'T FORGET THAT
YOU CANNOT LOAD LIMITED ITEMS! You can draft Angels to help you run a quest, 
and please note that quests should NOT have huge rewards -- the main point 
should be to have fun.  Deities have no business trying to enforce rules -- 
the most you should do to a player is a NOCHANNEL or similar light punishment.
Using the snoop command, Deities can keep track of players whether they are 
obeying the rules of roleplaying or not. Deities cannot have mortal characters. 

GODS (97-99):

	Gods can run quests just like Deities and it's nice to do reimbursements
too. However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace and enforcing the 
the roleplaying, using the various NOTELL-class commands, as well as deny,
purge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!)  Gods are expected
to help make the mud run more smoothly, power trips are strictly verbotten.
Not fufilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion. Gods
cannot have mortal characters.

92 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.
                          The Rules of ANATOLIA 
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

11) Take care of limited objects and quests.

12) Make sure that everyone is obeying the roleplaying rules.

-1 RULER 'CABAL RULER' 'RULER CABAL'~
.
	Rulers believe that Law is the key for success for us all. In the
ancient times, the realm of Anatolia had been covered by chaos from one
end to the other, with no law to protect anyone or anything. It was a time 
when only the strong survived, feeding on the corpses of the weak. The 
Rulers changed all that. They founded protected areas around thera,
guarding them with their lives. They have written the book of laws that
keeps their beliefs, and guard this book in their headquarters. The book
is everything to them, in case the book is lost, they fail to apply the
law like the way they can do when in possession of it. The first city 
they got under their protection was Midgaard and New Thalos, where many
people had migrated after the lamia attack in old Thalos. Today, the
Rulers are fighting the Chaos cabal, their now eternal enemy. All those
who defy the laws in protected areas are flagged as "criminals", and
hunted by all rulers.
~

-1 INVADER 'CABAL INVADER' 'INVADER CABAL'~
.
   Four hundred years ago, after the attack of the Knights orriginating from
the town of Gerilghem, the forces of evil had to retreat to Underdark, one
of the deepest and most evil places on this realm. It is said that the
darkness in the area soon started to become deeper and stronger. No one
knows what went on in the depths of the Underdark, but soon an army of
pure evil emerged, travelled to the lands cleaned by the Knights, slaying
all that it found on its way. The dark army spared no life, bringing
nothing but death to those who stood in its path. Inside the swamps west
of Midgaard, an army of Knights confronted them. The Knights were
numerous, outnumbering the dark army who called themselves Invaders, and
it seemed to be a doom for the dark army. That was when the great dark
cloud decended on the two armies. Although the events which took place
inside that dark cloud is not known, there is something that is written
down in the Chronicals of Anatolia. No man left the cloud alive, but the
only corpses to be found were the Knights'. 
~

-1 CHAOS 'CABAL CHAOS' 'CHAOS CABAL'~
.
  Chaos. The seed of the universe. It is everywhere. It is within us, around
us, it is all that everything originates from. Those who have seen the
power in chaos have come together. To found a unique force among the
chaos, they came together secretly and built themselves a fortress. They
are plaqued by the lawful works of the Rulers, constantly battle them
to rid them of their powers. They see the laws as chains that turn them
into slaves. So they fight for their freedom. It is an honour for a Chaos
member to be made wanted by the Rulers, it shows their respect for
freedom. When a Chaos member is flagged as criminal, his mood and his
powers increase, due to the new flow of chaotic powers.
~

-1 KNIGHT 'KNIGHT CABAL' 'CABAL KNIGHT'~
.
When the evil stormed the plains of our realm, killed the innocent
children of poor villagers, a great hate started to rise against the dark
souls that plaqued the land. The followers of the dark path was strong,
but the hate against them grew with each corpse they left on the ground.
In time, people who wished to fight against this evil gathered in the city
of Gerilghem, and started to build a large castle in the city. Training 
themselves for a battle against the evil, they mastered in heroic combat,
and started a jihad against the darkness. The evil withdrew to the depths
of thera, and once again peace came to the land. But it did not last long.
The forces of darkness formed a new army, named themselves Invaders, and
attacked back. For past few hundred years, these to forces have been
fighting a fierce battle. The Knights trying to bring peace, and the
Invaders are trying to bring death. The hate in the Knights for evil is 
great, and they hunt it, slay it whenever it is possible. They believe
that eternal peace can be found only when the last evil falls to its 
knees.

-1 HUNTER 'HUNTER CABAL' 'CABAL HUNTER'~
.
Where there's money, there's someone who wants to earn it. The merchants
from many different and far away parts of came together, forming a guild
among themselves. They do all kinds of work, money is the key to hire
them. They are superior with hunting, and they always seek for revenge. 
These group of merchants have one weakness that is known: Some of them
tend to sell out their friends for money. They are not cheap at all to
hire, costing perhaps hundreds of thousands of gold for the hardest tasks.
Their trade center is located at the city of New Thalos, and also serves
as their headquarters. The Hunters are a constanly changing cabal, that is
the most profitable way of earning more. Always change, and have someone
else pay for it!  
~

-1 SHALAFI 'SHALAFI CABAL' 'CABAL SHALAFI'~
.
  For many ages, the mortal magic on this realm was seen as evil by those
who couldn't understand the arcane arts. The performers of "the Art"
therefore, were hunted down and killed. Their magic was strong, but not
strong enough to fight the millions who went after them. One day, a great
magician among their order, decided to put an end to this massacre. 
All those who survived the attacks of the barbaric community were called
to the magically built tower of sorcery, where a great meeting was held.
The great mage, named Jutnirvas, took his place at the end of a huge hall
where all the mages were collected. He then began his forever unforgotten
speach:

  "Greetings performers of the Art! I know that you all feel nervous for the
fact that we, all those who managed to survive the hunt, are here in one 
place all together. Yes! I know the dangers of this meeting. If we are
found, we might be killed here together, and then the magic would
certainly fall. But with every new sunset, there are less of us on this
world. We must come together and fight against those who wish to see our
heads seperated from our bodies. There's only one thing that can save us:
The great power of the Art! The power of magic! We must make this tower
our first stronghold, a castle where we can defeat the outsiders. We 
will have to improve our magical powers, and this can only be achieved
by a long, disciplined work. We will need all sorts of magical power,
the good, the neutral, and the evil. They must all be worked, reserched,
so we can survive. And with us, our magic shall survive too, growing in
force each day. We will bind ourself together, not let chaos sweep away
what we will make possible. Now, will you fight by my side!!!?"

   The answer was a thundering yes from every singal person in the room. That
day, Shalafi was founded, and became a home for many of the great
magicians who lived in the following centuries. Jutnirvas's dream still
lives this day, and houses many reserch projects of the mages. Those
who can penetrate through the defenses of the Groove that lies around
the tower and also the undeads of the tower of high sorcery may hear the
screams of summoned demons, explosions of cast spells that shake the
