http://www.anatoliamud.org


How to Play
----------------------------

* Connect to the game by using any telnet client or TinTin:

	telnet localhost 4000
	
* To make your first immortal character, just start as a mortal character,
play at least as far as level 2 so that you can save your character. Then
edit the player file and change your level.  (After your first immortal,
you can advance other future immortal players to immortal levels).

* If you haven't already done so, read all the license docs listed in the
"Copyright and License" section. Anatolia is a derivative of ROM, and ROM
is a derivative of Merc and Merc is a derivative work of Diku Mud. You must
register your mud with the original Diku implementors.
  
* Of course you're going to change the title screen, help files, and so on.
Don't just globally erase the 'Merc', 'Diku', 'Rom' or 'Anatolia'
references, ok?  You wouldn't like it if we did that to your work,
so don't do it to ours.

Support
----------------------------

Also check the 'wizhelp' command and read the 'help' descriptions for the
individual immortal commands.
